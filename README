# This application is a textual simulation of the Apple Store. It features a library of songs, podcasts, and audiobooks, which the user can download and delete. It, moreover, also has a playlist functionality, which allows the user to arrange songs in a playlist, etc. 

On the technical side of things, it is coded in Java and is an Object-oriented program; the entire gamut of what OOP principles are integrated and used in this application. 
On top of this, I integrated a variety of data-structures, such as arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, Stacks, etc. 
In order to code the functionalities available to the user, a variety of methods, each of which utilize some means of searching and retrieving an object from these data-structures, were used. 

All in all, coding this application was a great exercise and boost to my programming skills, specifically as it pertains to designing an application and code which all logically and coherently hang together.
